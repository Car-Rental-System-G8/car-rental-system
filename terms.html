          <h2>Rental Terms & Conditions</h2>

          <h3>Eligibility Requirements</h3>
          <p>To rent a vehicle from HV Car Rental, customers must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Be at least 21 years of age (25 for premium vehicles)</li>
            <li>Possess a valid driver's license held for at least 1 year</li>
            <li>Present a major credit card in the renter's name</li>
            <li>
              Provide proof of insurance or purchase our insurance coverage
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Reservation & Payment</h3>
          <p>
            Reservations can be made online, by phone, or in person. A valid
            credit card is required to secure any reservation. The full rental
            amount will be charged at the time of pickup. We accept all major
            credit cards, but do not accept cash, debit cards, or prepaid cards
            for the security deposit.
          </p>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>
              <strong>Security Deposit:</strong> A security deposit of $200-$500
              (depending on vehicle category) will be held on your credit card
              during the rental period. This amount will be refunded upon
              vehicle return, subject to the condition assessment.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Fuel Policy</h3>
          <p>
            All vehicles are provided with a full tank of fuel and should be
            returned with a full tank. If the vehicle is returned with less fuel
            than at pickup, a refueling charge will apply at the current market
            rate plus a $25 service fee.
          </p>

          <h3>Mileage Policy</h3>
          <p>
            Standard rentals include 200 miles per day. Additional mileage will
            be charged at $0.35 per mile. Unlimited mileage packages are
            available at an additional cost.

          <h2>Insurance Policy</h2>

          <h3>Coverage Options</h3>
          <p>
            HV Car Rental offers several insurance coverage options to protect
            you during your rental period:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Basic Coverage (Included):</strong> Includes liability
              coverage up to state minimum requirements
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Standard Protection ($15/day):</strong> Includes liability
              coverage up to $50,000 and collision damage waiver with $1,000
              deductible
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Premium Protection ($25/day):</strong> Includes liability
              coverage up to $100,000, collision damage waiver with $500
              deductible, and personal effects coverage
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Full Coverage ($35/day):</strong> Includes all of the
              above plus zero deductible and roadside assistance
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Personal Insurance</h3>
          <p>
            If you have personal auto insurance, it may provide coverage for
            rental vehicles. We recommend checking with your insurance provider
            before declining our coverage options. You will be required to
            provide proof of insurance if declining our coverage.
          </p>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>
              <strong>Note:</strong> Regardless of the coverage option selected,
              damage resulting from prohibited uses (off-road driving, reckless
              operation, etc.) will not be covered and will be the full
              responsibility of the renter.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Credit Card Coverage</h3>
          <p>
            Some credit cards offer rental car insurance when the entire rental
            is charged to the card. This coverage is typically secondary to your
            personal insurance. Check with your credit card company for details.

          <h2>Damages & Liability</h2>

          <h3>Vehicle Inspection</h3>
          <p>
            All vehicles undergo a thorough inspection before each rental. We
            document the vehicle's condition, including any existing damage. We
            encourage customers to participate in this inspection at pickup and
            note any concerns before leaving the premises.
          </p>

          <h3>Customer Liability</h3>
          <p>The renter is responsible for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              All damage to the vehicle during the rental period not covered by
              the selected insurance option
            </li>
            <li>Loss or damage to vehicle keys, documents, or accessories</li>
            <li>Interior damage, including stains, burns, or tears</li>
            <li>Damage resulting from prohibited uses or negligence</li>
            <li>
              Towing or recovery costs if not covered by roadside assistance
            </li>
          </ul>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>
              <strong>Important:</strong> Using the vehicle for prohibited
              purposes (off-road driving, towing, racing, etc.) voids all
              insurance coverage and makes the renter fully liable for any
              resulting damage.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Reporting Accidents</h3>
          <p>In case of an accident, theft, or damage to the vehicle:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Contact local authorities immediately if required by law</li>
            <li>Notify HV Car Rental within 24 hours</li>
            <li>
              Complete an accident report form (available in the vehicle's glove
              compartment)
            </li>
            <li>Do not admit fault or liability at the scene</li>
            <li>
              Collect information from other parties involved, including
              insurance details
